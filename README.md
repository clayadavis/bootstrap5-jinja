This is a theme based on Bootstrap 5.

The theme is a good building block for a site. It is based on a simple navbar +
content layout. For a more blog-style layout, check out `bootblog4`.

Note that unlike previous versions of Bootstrap, icon fonts are not built-in.
You can get [Bootstrap Icons](https://icons.getbootstrap.com/) separately.

TODO: support Bootswatch font/color schemes through the `nikola subtheme`
command.
